This enhanced infrastructure focuses on high availability and scalability:

Servers (4):  We now have four servers:

Two web servers (Nginx) for distributing static content.
Two application servers for handling dynamic content and database interaction.
A separate database server for storing website data.
Load Balancers (2 in HAProxy Cluster):  Two HAProxy instances are configured as a cluster. This provides redundancy and ensures continued traffic distribution even if one load balancer fails.

Web Servers (2 x Nginx):  Dedicated web servers handle static content delivery, improving performance and scalability.

Application Servers (2):  Separate application servers manage dynamic content generation and database interaction, allowing independent scaling based on resource demands.

Database Server (1 x MySQL):  A dedicated database server provides isolation and better resource allocation for database operations.

Additional Components:

HAProxy Cluster: Clustering the load balancers eliminates a single point of failure (SPOF) at the load balancer level. If one HAProxy instance fails, the other takes over, ensuring uninterrupted traffic distribution.
Benefits of Split Components:

Improved Scalability:  Independent scaling of web servers, application servers, and the database allows for more targeted resource allocation. If web traffic increases, you can add more web servers without affecting application processing or database performance.

Isolation and Security:  Separation of components enhances security. A compromised web server cannot directly access the database server, potentially limiting damage in case of a security breach.

Why is this Better?

This infrastructure offers significant advantages over the previous versions:

High Availability:  Redundant load balancers and distributed components minimize downtime due to server failures.

Scalability:  Independent scaling of web servers, application servers, and the database allows for adaptation to changing traffic demands.

Security:  Separation of components improves security by limiting access between different parts of the infrastructure.
