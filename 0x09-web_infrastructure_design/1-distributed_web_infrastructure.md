This upgraded web infrastructure utilizes multiple servers for better performance, redundancy, and scalability:

Servers (2): We now have two servers: one dedicated web server (Nginx) and one application server. This separation allows for better resource allocation and potentially faster web serving.

Web Server (Nginx):  Nginx remains responsible for receiving user requests and serving static content like images and HTML files.

Application Server:  A dedicated application server handles complex logic specific to your website's functionality. It interacts with the database and generates dynamic content that gets sent back to the user's browser through Nginx.

Load Balancer (HAproxy):  HAproxy acts as a traffic director. It distributes incoming traffic from users across both the web servers, ensuring even load balancing and preventing one server from becoming overloaded.

Application Files (your codebase):  The codebase is likely deployed on the application server to be executed for dynamic content generation.

Database (MySQL):  MySQL remains the database for storing website data.

Additional Components:

Load Balancer Distribution Algorithm:  HAproxy can be configured with various distribution algorithms. A common choice is round-robin, which distributes requests evenly across available web servers. Each request is directed to the next server in a sequential order, ensuring fair allocation of traffic.

Load Balancer Setup (Active-Active vs. Active-Passive):  HAproxy can support both Active-Active and Active-Passive setups:

Active-Active: Both web servers handle user requests simultaneously. This offers high availability as a server failure won't take down the website completely. However, it requires more complex configuration and can introduce slight performance overhead.

Active-Passive:  Only one web server actively processes requests (primary). The other server (secondary) remains on standby as a hot backup. If the primary server fails, the secondary takes over, minimizing downtime. This setup is simpler to manage but offers less overall processing power.

Database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Cluster:  This setup involves two database servers:

Primary Node (Master):  This server receives all write requests (data updates) and keeps the main copy of the database.

Replica Node (Slave):  This server constantly replicates data from the primary node, maintaining an identical copy. Replica nodes can be used for read-only operations (like displaying data), reducing load on the primary server. In case of a primary server failure, a replica can potentially be promoted to become the new primary, minimizing downtime.

Issues and Limitations:

SPOFs:  While redundancy is improved, there are still potential SPOFs:

Single Database: If the database server fails, the entire website becomes unavailable. Implementing a database cluster with multiple replicas can mitigate this risk.
Load Balancer: A failure in the load balancer can disrupt traffic distribution and potentially bring down the website. Utilizing redundant load balancers can provide high availability.
Security Issues:

No Firewall: The absence of a firewall leaves the servers vulnerable to malicious attacks. A firewall acts as a security barrier, filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined rules.
No HTTPS: Communication is not encrypted using HTTPS. This exposes user data (like login credentials) to potential interception during transmission. Implementing HTTPS encrypts data traffic, ensuring secure communication.
No Monitoring: Lack of monitoring tools makes it difficult to proactively identify and address potential issues like server overload or software errors. Monitoring can provide valuable insights into system health and performance.
