This web infrastructure uses a single server to run all the essential components for a website:

Server: A server is a powerful computer designed to store data and deliver it to other devices over a network. In this case, the server runs the web server software (Nginx), application server, your codebase, and the database.

Domain Name (foobar.com):  A domain name acts like an address for your website on the internet. People can easily remember and type "foobar.com" instead of the server's numerical IP address (8.8.8.8 in this example).

DNS Record (www):  DNS (Domain Name System) acts like a phonebook for the internet. When someone types "www.foobar.com [invalid URL removed]" in their browser, the DNS record tells the browser to look for the website at the IP address 8.8.8.8. In this case, the "www" is a specific type of DNS record that points to the main website.

Web Server (Nginx): Nginx is software that listens for incoming requests from users' browsers trying to access foobar.com. It then retrieves the necessary files (your codebase) to display the website and sends them back to the user's browser.

Application Server:  This component is a bit ambiguous in a single-server setup.  While application servers typically handle complex logic and interact with the database,  a simpler web application might not require a dedicated application server. In this case, Nginx itself might handle serving the application along with static files.

Database (MySQL):  A database is a software application that stores and manages website data. MySQL is a popular database management system used for storing information like user accounts, product details, or blog posts (depending on the website's purpose).

Communication Protocol: The server communicates with the user's computer using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).  HTTP is a set of rules that defines how data is formatted and transmitted between web servers and browsers.

Issues and Limitations (SPOF, Downtime, Scalability)
This single-server infrastructure has some limitations:

SPOF (Single Point of Failure):  Everything relies on one server. If the server crashes, the entire website goes down (foobar.com becomes unavailable).

Downtime during Maintenance:  When updates or maintenance are needed (like deploying new code), the entire server might need to be restarted, causing website downtime.

Limited Scalability:  A single server can only handle a certain amount of traffic. If foobar.com experiences a surge in popularity, the server might overload and become slow or unresponsive.

These limitations can be addressed by using a more robust web infrastructure with multiple servers for better performance, redundancy, and scalability.
