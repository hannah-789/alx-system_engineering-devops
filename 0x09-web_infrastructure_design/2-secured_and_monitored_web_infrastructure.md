Building upon the previous infrastructure, we've added security and monitoring elements:

Servers (2):  We retain the dedicated web server and application server.

Web Server (Nginx):  Nginx continues to serve static content.

Application Server:  The application server handles dynamic content generation and interacts with the database.

Load Balancer (HAproxy):  HAproxy distributes traffic across the web servers.

Application Files (your codebase):  The codebase resides on the application server.

Database (MySQL):  The MySQL database stores website data.

Firewalls (3):  Firewalls are added for improved security:

One firewall can be positioned in front of the load balancer to filter incoming traffic and block potential attacks before they reach the web servers.
Two additional firewalls can be placed in front of the web server and application server, respectively, to further restrict access and provide granular control.
SSL Certificate (HTTPS):  A single SSL certificate is installed on the load balancer, enabling HTTPS for secure communication between users and the website.

Monitoring Clients (3):  Three monitoring clients are deployed:

One client can be installed on each server (web server, application server, and database) to collect performance metrics and system logs.
Additional Components:

HTTPS and Load Balancer:  Terminating SSL at the load balancer level simplifies certificate management but introduces a potential bottleneck. Decrypting and encrypting traffic adds processing overhead to the load balancer, potentially affecting performance under high traffic.

Monitoring Data Collection: Monitoring clients typically collect data through:

System agents that run on the servers and periodically gather performance metrics (CPU, memory usage) and resource utilization data.
Log file monitoring that reads and analyzes server logs to identify errors, security events, and application behavior.
Monitoring Web Server QPS (Queries Per Second):  To monitor QPS, the monitoring tool can track the number of requests received by the web server over a specific time interval. This data can be used to identify traffic spikes and potential bottlenecks.

Issues and Limitations:

Single MySQL Server:  Having only one MySQL server creates a single point of failure (SPOF). If the server fails, the entire website becomes unavailable. Implementing a database cluster with multiple replicas for read-offloading and automatic failover can address this issue.

Identical Server Components:  While having dedicated servers for web and application logic provides separation of concerns, it might be inefficient if both servers have idle resources.  Consider using containerization technologies like Docker to run multiple instances of the web server and application server on a single physical server, maximizing resource utilization. This approach requires careful configuration and management to ensure isolation and proper communication between containers.

SSL Termination at Load Balancer:  While convenient, terminating SSL at the load balancer adds processing overhead and introduces a potential single point of failure. Consider terminating SSL directly on the web servers if performance becomes a critical factor. This approach requires managing individual certificates on each web server.
